Writing the whole service was challenging for me 
since I am not a developer and this was my first 
time working with Flask. Trying to understand Flask’s structure, 
application context, and how authentication and database 
layers fit together required extra effort and learning.

Writing the test cases was more manageable, as
I already have experience with API test automation but
not without the guidnace of internet sources and Gen AI.

The changes I introduced, particularly stricter access 
control and rate limiting, required updates and additions 
to the test suite. While I initially underestimated 
the effort needed to align tests with these changes which
took a lot of time too, the result is a set of reliable 
test cases that help ensure the microblog API cannot be 
spammed and is only accessible with proper authorization, 
which is important from a security perspective.
